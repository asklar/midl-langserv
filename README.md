# MIDL RT language support

Development in progress

## Functionality

- Syntax highlighting
- Basic semantic parsing
- Prototype squigglies and autocompletions

## Doesn't work yet

- Still need to figure out how to get the vsix to work when packaged. Works ok when launching from the extension repo clone.
